## US Yield Curve Data

The dataset used in this project is the US Yield Curve data from 1972 to 2000. It includes the yields of various bonds with different maturities, which are essential for estimating the Dynamic Nelson Siegel model.

### Data Source

The data can be accessed from the following URL:

- [US Yield Curve Data](https://www.dropbox.com/s/inpnlugzkddp42q/bonds.csv?dl=1)

### Data Format

The data is in CSV format and is structured as follows:

- The first column contains the dates.
- The subsequent columns represent the yields for different maturities.

### Usage

This data will be loaded and preprocessed in the project to facilitate the estimation of the Dynamic Nelson Siegel model using various approaches.
